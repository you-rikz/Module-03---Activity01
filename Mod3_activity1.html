                <p class ="art"> Jau Umandal and PGJC-Navy bucked an error-plagued opener to take down Army-Katinko Oil in four sets, 20-25, 25-19, 25-21, 25-18 in the 2022 Spikersâ€™ Turf Open Conference, Thursday at the Paco Arena.

                    Umandal dropped a conference-high 29 points on 26 attacks, two aces, and a block to go along with 10 excellent receptions and seven excellent digs in just four sets to help the Sea Lions bounce back from a tough five-set loss against National University-Sta. Elena last Tuesday.</p>
